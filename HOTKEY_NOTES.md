# Random Notes on Random NVIM Commands I looked up

I want to clear a search: `:noh` (no highlighting command)

I want to remove a single character: `x`

Go to:
- Start of the file: `gg` or `(`
- End of the file: `G` or `)`
- Next word: `w` (goes to start) or `e` (goes to end)
- Previous word: `b` (goes to start) or `ge` (goes to end)

I want to indent a single line: `>`
I want to indent multiple lines: `v` for visual mode -> select the text you want to indent -> `>`

Start recording a macro: `qx` where `x` is some character
Save the macro: `q`
Execute the macro: `@x` where `x` is some character

I want to go back to the previous file: `<C-^>`
