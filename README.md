# nvim-config
My personal nvim config, mostly based on typecraft's "From 0 to IDE"

Preferred nerd font: https://github.com/marnen/borg-sans-mono

## Prerequisites

Most of the plugins will install automatically upon opening nvim for the first time.

Other external dependencies:
- Node/NPM for some automatically installed language tools
- Python (specifically exposing the `python3` command)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for telescope.nvim
- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) for integrated git window
